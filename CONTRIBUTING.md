please do check existing issues).

to express your interest.

If you want to on an existing issue please comment your intent on the

Feel free to fork, develop and submit pull requests. I will try to be
responsive - but apologies in advance if I am not!

My personal style is to to prefer regular small changes rather than less
frequent complex changes.

Please check all the tests pass before submitting a pull reqeust, and
please add new tests for any new features.

Thank you :)
